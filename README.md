# White Cane Navigation System

This is an Arduino-based smart white cane designed to help visually impaired individuals detect obstacles using an IR (Infrared) sensor.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Uses an IR sensor to detect nearby obstacles
- Activates a vibration motor when an object is detected
- Built with Arduino

## ðŸ§° Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno
- IR sensor (Digital)
- Vibration motor
- Jumper wires

## ðŸ§  How It Works
- The IR sensor checks for obstacles in front of the cane.
- If an obstacle is detected, the vibration motor is turned on.
- If no obstacle is detected, the motor stays off.

## ðŸ“„ Code File
The main Arduino sketch is in `cane.ino`.
